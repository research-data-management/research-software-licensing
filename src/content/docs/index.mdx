This is an overview of licensing options for software. The focus lies on code
that is developed for and used in research and that should be made available
free of charge to other researchers and the general public.

## Disclaimer


In case programmer(s), group leader, collaborators or your institution consider
to commercially exploit the software or have other needs, such as sharing the
software with a specific academic partner only, please stop here and seek advice
from your legal department.

If you create computer programs in the course of an employment relationship,
your employer has far-reaching rights with regard to the dissemination and use of
these programs.

<Aside type="caution">Make sure you have the permission from your employer to publish your code as you see fit!</Aside>

<Aside type="caution">This is not legal advice! You are responsible to not
violate any laws and not act against the interests of your employer. If in
doubt, ask a lawyer!</Aside>
