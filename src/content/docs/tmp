# There are three broad categories of license type that can be applied to research software.

# The AGPLv3 is an example for a [*Copyleft license*](/Guide-to-Research-Software-Licensing/Copyleft-License-\(Free-Software\)). This type of license ensures that a program is [free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) and requires all modified and extended versions of the program to be free software as well.

# Other types of licenses suited for research software are [*permissive licenses*](/Guide-to-Research-Software-Licensing/Permissive-License) and a [*copyright waiver*](/Guide-to-Research-Software-Licensing/Public-Domain) that places your work in the public domain.

# ## FAQ

**# We collect questions and answers to common questions around software licensing issues. If you have a question that you think might be of interest to other people as well, please [let us know](mailto:fdm-servicestelle.thuenen.de).**

# + **Q**: Is it ok if my software contains code chunks from Stack Overflow and similar platforms?
# + **A**: Depends on the platform. Code on StackOverflow is currently licensed under one of the CC BY-SAs, see [https://stackoverflow.com/help/licensing](https://stackoverflow.com/help/licensing). This allows re-use, but under conditions that are not trivial to satisfy. **Get in touch with [recht@thuenen.de](mailto:recht@thuenen.de) if you must use such code.**

# -----------------

# + **Q**: Is it ok if my software contains chunks of code generated by AI (e.g., ChatGPT)
# + **A**: Code from output of large language models (LLM) such as ChatGPT might well be subject to copyright, but you might have a hard time to find out by whom and whether it is licensed in a manner suited for re-use. This question is subject to current discourse in the respective specialized legal communities.  Also see the [statement of the DFG regarding generative models of text and image creation](https://www.dfg.de/resource/blob/289676/89c03e7a7a8a024093602995974832f9/230921-statement-executive-committee-ki-ai-data.pdf).
**# If you want to publish software that contains code you got from an LLM such as ChatGPT, you need to make sure that ChatGPT didn't plagiarize that code**.

# ------------------

# + **Q**: I am using CRAN packeges. What does that mean for licensing my software that depends on them?
# + **A**: CRAN packages might have different licenses. On the packages' page on CRAN (e.g. [https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/zoo/index.html](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/zoo/index.html)) there is a field "License". **Usually CRAN packages [have a well known Open Source license](https://www.r-project.org/Licenses/) and can be used perfectly fine as part of another Open Source project. Just use [AGPLv3](/Guide-to-Research-Software-Licensing/Copyleft-License-\(Free-Software\))**.

# -------------------

# + **Q**: What about development-versions of CRAN packages on GitHub?
# + **A**: **Usually no problem. Just follow the guidance above**.





// # <p><strong>Check the *notification of funding* for the project!</strong></p>


// # YES - Continue to point 2. below: "Have all contributors to the software agreed that you publish it as Open Source?"

// # NO  Continue to point 2. below: "Have all contributors to the software agreed that you publish it as Open Source?"
// # </item>

// # **

// #    Preferably get the agreement in writing. An elegant way to do that, if you develop on a repository hosting platform such as GitLab or GitHub, is to require new contributors to add their name to the agreement-document with their first merge request.

// #    **YES** -> Continue to point 3. below: "Do you use third-party code as part of your program?"
// #    **NO**&nbsp; ->  Talk to them and get their agreement!

// # <item>Choose and apply the license
// # The service unit RDM recommends to use the Affero GNU General Public License Version 3 (AGPL v3)**.

// #    This strong Copyleft license is the most compatible Open Source license and can be applied to most programs that incorporate third-party code under Open Source licenses. The AGPL v3 fosters, more than any other license, the sustainable availability of the source code of your work as well as that of future derivatives, improvements and adaptions. Therefore it is best suited to support Open Science, reproducibility and transparency.
