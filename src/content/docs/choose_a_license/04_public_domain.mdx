If you put software in the "Public Domain", you cede all rights (the "copyright") to the software and donate it to the world. This was the dominant mode of publishing research software from the beginning of research software into the 1990ies. Software developed by US federal employees has to be published in the Public Domain. Publishing research software into the Public Domain is still popular with researchers who do not want to have anything to do with legal issues and believe that research output should belong to humanity. Note: Technically this is not a "license" but rather a "waiver". Also, technically, the corresponding concept in German law, "Gemeinfreiheit", is not identical to the anglo-american "public domain". For the matter at hand however, it should be ok to gloss over these differences.

## üöÄ Advantages

+ Maximum ease of re-use. Your software can be combined with any code and re-published under any conditions.
+ Escape from legal considerations and entanglements.
+ Compatible with reproducibility and transparency requirements of good scientific practice.

## ‚ÄºÔ∏èDrawbacks

+ No legal requirement for (re-)users to credit you. While giving credit is a community-norm in academia, is is sometimes forgotten with regard to software. You can improve the situation by adding a reminder to the software distribution that you expect to be credited, and how (e.g. "cite my paper ...").
+ The software will be available for use you might consider freeloading, because it can easily be re-packaged, renamed and sold ...
