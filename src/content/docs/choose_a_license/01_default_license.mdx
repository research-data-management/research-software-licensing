### If in doubt, use the AGPLv3 ðŸš€

The **GNU Affero General Public License** Version 3 (AGPL v3) is a very good
choice for research software. This strong Copyleft license can be applied to
most programs that incorporate third-party code under Open Source licenses (see
Figure 1). The AGPL v3 fosters, more than any other license, the sustainable
availability of the source code of your work as well as that of future
derivatives, improvements and adaptions. Therefore it is best suited to support
Open Science, reproducibility and transparency.

<Aside type="caution">
  <p>Situations where you might not want to use the AGPL include
  cooperation-projects with private companies or when most of the code in your
  field is licensed under a <a href="../03_permissive">permissive
  license</a></p>

### Types of Open Source licenses

There are three broad categories of Open Source license type that can be applied
to research software. The AGPLv3 is an example for a **"Copyleft license"**. This type
of license ensures that a program is free software and requires all modified and
extended versions of the program to be free software as well. Other types of
licenses suited for research software are **"permissive licenses"** and a **"copyright
waiver"** that places your work in the public domain.
