Proprietary software is all software that is made available under conditions
that do not allow free use, modification and re-distribution. Using proprietary
software to generate research results is a problem because it usually prohibits
or hinders reproducibility and transparency, which are core scientific
principles.

Software written by researchers often becomes proprietary by accident: If you do
not license your software, copyright law ("Urheberrecht") applies automatically.
Any software encumbered with full copyright restrictions is practically not
usable for other researchers. **It is important that you license your software
or waive the copyright!**
