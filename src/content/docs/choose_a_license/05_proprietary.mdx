Proprietary software is all software that is made available under conditions that do not allow free use, modification and re-distribution. Using proprietary software to generate research results is a problem because it usually prohibits or hinders reproducibility and transparency, which are core scientific principles.

Software written by researchers often becomes proprietary by accident: If you do not license your software, copyright law ("Urheberrecht") applies automatically. Any software encumbered with full copyright restrictions is practically not usable for other researchers. **It is important that you license your software or waive the copyright!**.
