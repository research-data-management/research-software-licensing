"Permissive licenses" have gained a lot popularity since the 2010s, but not
necessarily among researchers. The main practical difference, compared to the
Public Domain, when applied to research software, is the legal requirement to
give the original creator of the software credit in the form of a retained
copyright statement when the software or derived works are re-distributed.

## Advantages

+ Excellent ease of re-use. Your software can be combined with any code
  published under a common free-software license to create added value.
+ Compatible with reproducibility and transparency requirements of good
  scientific practice.
+ Legal requirement to credit the original author

## Drawbacks

+ The software will be available for use you might consider freeloading, because
  it can easily be re-packaged, renamed, re-licensed and sold ...
+ The software can be "closed", meaning that anybody can re-distribute it, or
  future versions of it, without the source code, thus making it unfit for use in
  scientific work.

There are a large number of licenses in this category but the two most popular ones should be sufficient to cover the vast majority of use cases:

## <Icon class="inlineimg" name="external" /><a href="https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html">MIT License (aka Expat License)</a>

### Features

+ Very short, easy understandable license text.

##  <Icon class="inlineimg" name="external" /><a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache 2.0 License</a>


### Features

+ Includes a "patent grant". This means that a license is also granted for any
patents that the software may incorporate. This is mainly interesting for
commercial use of the software, where it reduces the business risk.
