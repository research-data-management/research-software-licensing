Even if the copyright restrictions of your software are not mitigated by a
license or a copyright waiver, everybody can run it as they see fit.

If your software provides you a competitive advantage and you do not want other
researchers to profit from it, you have to keep it secret. There is no obvious
way to keep part of your methods (the software) secret and at the same time have
your results recognized as valid scientific output.
