 Find the terms under which you obtained the code. There might be a file
"LICENSING", "COPYING", "RIGHTS", "USAGE" or similar in the distribution. If
that fails, have a look at the website where you downloaded it. To search for
licensing information in large projects, there are tools such as
[<Icon class="inlineimg" name="external" />fossa-cli](https://github.com/fossas/fossa-cli/) and
[<Icon class="inlineimg" name="external"/>Licensee](https://licensee.github.io/licensee/) to help you with that.

  ### Is the third party software licensed under a different "GPL-compatible" Open Source License?

  <p>The Free Software Foundation maintains a list of [<Icon class="inlineimg"

  ### Did you obtain multiple third party components under different licenses?

  <CardGrid>

    <Card title="⚠️ YES">

      <p>Things might get complicated. For example if you want to publish code
      that is derived from multiple components with different "reciprocal"
      licenses such as GPLv2 and GPLv3, there is no simple straightforward way
      to do it. **Get in touch with an expert consultant to figure it out**.</p>

  ### Did you obtain the third party software under proprietary license?
  <CardGrid>
    <Card title="❌️YES">

      <p>If you obtained the software under a proprietary license, you usually
      can't re-distribute the software as part of your work. Proprietary
      licenses are most often attached to software you had to buy and they
      usually prohibit re-distribution. **Get in touch with with an expert
      consultant to try find a workaround**.</p>

    <Card title="⚠️ YES">
      <p>**Continue to point 6.**</p>
    </Card>

    <Card title="❌️ NO">

      <p>If you can't find a license or a public-domain dedication, you can't
      re-distribute the software as part of your work. **Get in touch with the
      vendor or programmer of the third-party software and obtain
      permission**.</p>
