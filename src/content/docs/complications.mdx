 Find the terms under which you obtained the code. There might be a file
"LICENSING", "COPYING", "RIGHTS", "USAGE" or similar in the distribution. If
that fails, have a look at the website where you downloaded it. To search for
licensing information in large projects, there are tools such as
[<Icon class="inlineimg" name="external" />fossa-cli](https://github.com/fossas/fossa-cli/) and
[<Icon class="inlineimg" name="external"/>Licensee](https://licensee.github.io/licensee/) to help you with that.

  <Card title="✅ YES">

    licenses](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses)</p>.

  <CardGrid>
    <Card title="✅ YES">

      <p>If the third-party software is licensed under a different Open Source
      license, which is listed as GPL-compatible, you are all good if you

  ### Did you obtain the third party software under a proprietary license?
  <CardGrid>
    <Card title="❌️YES">

      <p>If you obtained the software under a proprietary license, you usually
      can't re-distribute the software as part of your work. Proprietary
      licenses are most often attached to software you had to buy and they
      usually prohibit re-distribution. **Get in touch with with an expert
      consultant to try find a workaround**.</p>

    <Card title="⚠️NO">
      <p>**Continue to point 5.**</p>

  ### Do you have any license for the third party software?
  <CardGrid>
    <Card title="⚠️ YES">
      <p>**Continue to point 6.**</p>
    </Card>

    <Card title="❌️ NO">

      <p>If you can't find a license or a public-domain dedication, you can't
      re-distribute the software as part of your work. **Get in touch with the
      vendor or programmer of the third-party software and obtain
      permission**.</p>

  ### ⚠️ The licensing situation of the third-party code is not covered here.

  <p>The license of the third-party software doesn't seem to fall into one of
  the categories above. Maybe you are facing a more complex situation, e.g. if
  you intend to use different pieces of third-party code that are licensed under
  incompatible terms.</p>
  <p>**Get in touch with with an expert consultant to try figure it out**.</p>
