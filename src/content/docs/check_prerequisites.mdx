  Figure out whether you are restricted in choosing the terms for publishing the
  software.
</p>

<Steps>

<ol style="clear:right;">

<li>
<h3>Has the funding agency imposed restrictions?</h3>

**Check the *notification of funding* for the project!**

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="⚠️ YES">
    **Keep these restrictions in mind!**<br />
    Continue to point 2.
  </Card>
  <Card title="✅ NO">
    Continue to point 2.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>
</li>

<li>
<h3>Have all contributors to the software agreed that you publish it as Open Source?</h3>

**Preferably get the agreement in writing**. An elegant way to do that, if you
develop on a repository hosting platform such as GitLab or GitHub, is to require
new contributors to add their name to the agreement-document with their first
merge request.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="✅ YES">
    Continue to point 3.
  </Card>
  <Card title="⚠️ NO">
    **Talk to them and get their agreement!**
  </Card>
</CardGrid>
</li>

<li>
<h3>Do you use third-party code as part of your program?</h3>

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="⚠️ YES">
    <LinkButton href="../complications">**Check for complications!**</LinkButton>
  </Card>
  <Card title="✅ NO">
    <LinkButton href="../choose_a_license/01_default_license" variant="secondary">**Choose a license!**</LinkButton>
  </Card>
</CardGrid>
</li>

</ol>
</Steps>
